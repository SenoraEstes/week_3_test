    <h2>All about Penguins!</h2>

    <p>Penguins look like they're flying through the water rather than swimming.</p>
    
    <h2>What makes Penguins such good swimmers</h2>
    <p>They have tiny feathers that make them virtually waterproof, this keeps them warm and also hold air so that they are more bouyant</p>
